# Source 2 of 3: Codecov's public compare API, used when the codecov/patch check
# run produced no verdict.
#
# This is Codecov's data but not Codecov's verdict: the API's patch totals cover
# base_commit..head, and base_commit is the newest ancestor Codecov holds a
# report for rather than where the branch was cut, so the range can be wider
# than the pull request. When that is the case the difference is reported rather
# than hidden, because this source only runs when the check run gave nothing and
# the alternative is a purely local number.
#
# Environment:
#   PR_NUMBER, HEAD_SHA, BASE_REF      - provided by the composite action
#   FAIL_UNDER                         - from read-codecov-config.sh
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_OUTPUT, GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY - provided by the runner
#
# Sets resolved=true when Codecov's number was authoritative (pass or fail).
# Exits 0 with resolved=false when it cannot be trusted in time, so the caller
# computes patch coverage locally. A fetch or parse failure never passes.
