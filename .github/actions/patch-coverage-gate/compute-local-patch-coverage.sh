# Computes patch coverage locally from the archived coverage artifacts with
# diff-cover and enforces the threshold. Mirrors Codecov's combined patch
# semantics: all backend and frontend reports feed a single diff-cover
# invocation, so one pooled percentage covers the whole diff.
#
# Go cover profiles are converted to LCOV in-house (go-cover-to-lcov.awk) and
# frontend LCOV files are used as-is, so diff-cover receives a single format
# and no third-party converters are needed.
#
# Environment:
#   BASE_REF                                - provided by the composite action
#   FAIL_UNDER, CODECOV_IGNORE_FILE         - from read-codecov-config.sh
#   GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY                     - provided by the runner
#
# Expects the coverage artifacts to be downloaded under coverage-artifacts/.
