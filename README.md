        <img src="resources/images/sample-app-self-registration-basic.png" alt="Self Registration Username Password" width="400">
    </p>

2. After registration, use the same credentials to **"Sign In"**.

    <p align="left">
        <img src="resources/images/sample-app-login.png" alt="Login to Sample App" width="400">
    </p>

3. Upon successful login, you'll see the home page with your access token.


#### Obtain System API Token

To access the system APIs of Thunder, you need a token with system permissions. Follow the steps below to obtain a system API token.

1. Run the following command, replacing `<application_id>` with the sample app ID generated during "Setup the product."

```bash
curl -k -X POST 'https://localhost:8090/flow/execute' \
  -d '{"applicationId":"<application_id>","flowType":"AUTHENTICATION"}'
```
2. Extract the `flowId` value from the response.
```json
{"flowId":"<flow_id>","flowStatus":"INCOMPLETE", ...}
```

3. Run the following command, replacing `<flow_id>` with the `flowId` value you extracted above.
```bash
curl -k -X POST 'https://localhost:8090/flow/execute' \
  -d '{"flowId":"<flow_id>", "inputs":{"username":"admin","password":"admin", "requested_permissions":"system"},"action": "action_001"}'
```

4. Obtain the system API token by extracting the `assertion` value from the response.
```json
{"flowId":"<flow_id>","flowStatus":"COMPLETE","data":{},"assertion":"<assertion>"}
```

#### Try Out Client Credentials Flow

The Client Credentials flow is used to obtain an access token for machine-to-machine communication. This flow does not require user interaction and is typically used for server-to-server communication.

To try out the Client Credentials flow, follow these steps:

1. Create a Client Application

   Application creation is secured functionality, so you first need to obtain a system API token as mentioned in the "Obtain System API Token" section above.

   Run the following command, replacing `<assertion>` with the assertion value obtained from the previous step.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/applications \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <assertion>' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Test Sample App",
        "description": "Initial testing App",
        "inbound_auth_config": [
            {
                "type": "oauth2",
                "config": {
                    "client_id": "<client_id>",
                    "client_secret": "<client_secret>",
                    "redirect_uris": [
                        "https://localhost:3000"
                    ],
                    "grant_types": [
                        "client_credentials"
                    ],
                    "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic",
                    "pkce_required": false,
                    "public_client": false,
                    "scopes": ["api:read", "api:write"]
                }
            }
        ]
    }'
    ```

2. Obtain an Access Token

   Use the following cURL command to obtain an access token using the Client Credentials flow. Make sure to replace the `<client_id>` and `<client_secret>` with the values you used when creating the client application.

    ```bash
    curl -k -X POST https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token \
      -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
      -u '<client_id>:<client_secret>'
    ```

For development, use the `.env` file approach:

- Navigate to the sample app directory:

  ```bash
  cd samples/apps/react-vanilla-sample
  ```

- Create a file `.env` in the path `samples/apps/react-vanilla-sample/` by copying `.env.example`:

  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

- Edit the `.env` file and configure the required values:

  ```env
  # Application ID registered in Thunder
  VITE_REACT_APP_AUTH_APP_ID={your-application-id}
  
  # Thunder server endpoints
  VITE_REACT_APP_SERVER_FLOW_ENDPOINT=https://localhost:8090/flow
  VITE_REACT_APPLICATIONS_ENDPOINT=https://localhost:8090/applications
  
  # Set to false for native flow, true for OAuth redirect flow
  VITE_REACT_APP_REDIRECT_BASED_LOGIN=false
  ```

  > **Note**: For OAuth redirect flow, additional configurations like `VITE_REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID`, `VITE_REACT_APP_SERVER_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT`, and `VITE_REACT_APP_SERVER_TOKEN_ENDPOINT` are required. See `.env.example` for the complete list.

- Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
