#### (Optional) Step 3: Configure the sample app

Open the `runtime.json` file in the thunder-sample-app-<version>/dist directory and update the configurations as per your setup. The default configurations should work for most cases, but you can customize the following properties:

- `applicationID`: The ID of the application you want to use for authentication. By default, it is set to `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`.
- `flowEndpoint`: The endpoint for the flow execution API. By default, it is set to `https://localhost:8090/flow/execute`.

#### Step 4: Start the sample app

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:3000` to see the sample app in action.

### Try Out the Product

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a User

Create a user in the system to tryout the authentication flows. You can use the following cURL command to create a user with the required attributes.

  ```bash
  curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/users \
  -d '{
      "organizationUnit": "456e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
      "type": "superhuman",
      "attributes": {
          "username": "thor",
          "password": "thor@123",
          "email": "thor@thunder.sky",
          "firstName": "Thor",
          "lastName": "Odinson",
          "age": 1534,
          "abilities": [
              "strength",
              "speed",
              "healing"
          ],
          "address": {
              "city": "Asgard",
              "zip": "00100"
          }
      }
  }'
  ```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Try Out Client Credentials Flow

```bash
curl -k -X POST https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
  -u 'client123:secret123'
```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Try Out Authorization Code Flow

Authorization code flow requires you to setup a gate client to handle the login and error redirection. Add the following configurations to the `deployment.yaml` file to configure your own gate client.

  ```yaml
  gate_client:
    hostname: "localhost"
    port: 9090
    scheme: "https"
    login_path: "/login"
    error_path: "/error"
  ```

- Open the following URL in your browser:

  ```bash
  https://localhost:8090/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=client123&redirect_uri=https://localhost:3000&scope=openid&state=state_1
  ```

- Enter the credentials of the user you created in the first step.

- After successful authentication, you will be redirected to the redirect URI with the authorization code and state.

  ```bash
  https://localhost:3000/?code=<code>&state=state_1
  ```

- Copy the authorization code and exchange it for an access token using the following cURL command:

  ```bash
  curl -k -X POST 'https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token' \
  -u 'client123:secret123' \
  -d 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
  -d 'redirect_uri=https://localhost:3000' \
  -d 'code=<code>'
  ```

  - **Client ID:** `client123`
  - **Client Secret:** `secret123`

##### Refresh an Access Token

If the refresh grant is enabled for the application, a refresh token will be issued along with the access token. The refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to log in again. Use the following cURL command to refresh an access token:

  ```bash
  curl -k -X POST 'https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token' \
  -u 'client123:secret123' \
  -d 'grant_type=refresh_token' \
  -d 'refresh_token=<refresh_token>'
  ```

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Try Username and Password Login

Open the sample app in your browser and enter the username and password you created in the first step. If the login is successful, you will be redirected to the home page of the sample app with the access token.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Try Google Login

- Create an OAuth application in your Google account following the instructions given in the [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingcred).
  - Configure the Authorized origin and Redirect URI as per your application.

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Try SMS OTP Login

SMS One-Time Password (OTP) authentication allows users to authenticate using a one-time code sent to their mobile number. Prior to using SMS OTP, you need to configure a message provider to send SMS messages. Follow the steps below to set up SMS OTP authentication.

##### Step 1: Configure a Message Provider

Configure a message provider to send SMS messages. You can use services like Twilio, Vonage, or a custom service of your choice.

```bash
curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/notification-senders/message \
-d '{
  "name": "Custom SMS Sender",
  "description": "Sender for sending SMS messages",
  "provider": "custom",
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "url",
      "value": "<custom_sms_provider_url>"
    },
    {
      "name": "http_method",
      "value": "POST"
    },
    {
      "name": "content_type",
      "value": "JSON"
    }
  ]
}'
```

> Note: Refer [Message Provider Configuration Guide](/docs/content/configure-message-providers.md) for more details on configuring message providers.

##### Step 2: Update SMS OTP Flow Configuration

Update the `senderName` property in the `auth_flow_config_sms` flow definition to use your configured message sender.

##### Step 3: Configure Application to Use SMS OTP Flow

Update the system application to use the SMS OTP authentication flow template:

```bash
curl -kL -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/applications/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 \
--data '{
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "name": "Test SPA",
    "description": "Initial testing App",
    "client_id": "client123",
    "client_secret": "***",
    "redirect_uris": [
        "https://localhost:3000"
    ],
    "grant_types": [
        "client_credentials",
        "authorization_code"
    ],
    "auth_flow_graph_id": "auth_flow_config_sms"
}'
```

  > Note: Refer [Authentication Flow Customization Guide](/docs/content/customize-auth-flow.md) for more details on customizing authentication flows.

##### Step 4: Create a User with Mobile Number

Create a user with a `mobileNumber` attribute to receive SMS OTP:

```bash
curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/users \
-d '{
    "organizationUnit": "456e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
    "type": "superhuman",
    "attributes": {
        "username": "thor",
        "password": "thor@123",
        "email": "thor@thunder.sky",
        "firstName": "Thor",
        "lastName": "Odinson",
        "age": 1534,
        "abilities": [
            "strength",
            "speed",
            "healing"
        ],
        "address": {
            "city": "Asgard",
            "zip": "00100"
        },
        "mobileNumber": "+94xxxxxxxxx"
    }
}'
```

##### Step 5: Try Out SMS OTP Authentication

- Initiate the authentication flow with your application ID:

  ```bash
  curl -kL -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
  -d '{
      "applicationId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "flowType": "AUTHENTICATION"
  }'
  ```

  You'll receive a response with a flow ID and username input request.

- Provide the username to continue the flow:

  ```bash
  curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
  -d '{
      "flowId": "<flow_id>",
      "inputs": {
          "username": "thor"
      }
  }'
  ```

  An OTP will be sent to the user's mobile number.

- Complete authentication by providing the OTP:

  ```bash
  curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
  -d '{
      "flowId": "<flow_id>",
      "inputs": {
          "otp": "696546"
      }
  }'
  ```

- If the OTP is valid, you will receive a response with the auth assertion.

#### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Try Self Registration

Self-registration allows users to create their own accounts. Open the sample app in your browser and click on the "Sign up" button. You will be presented with the registration options based on the configured registration flow for the application.

When you configure an authentication flow for an application, Thunder automatically assigns the equivalent registration flow. For example, if you set `auth_flow_graph_id` to `auth_flow_config_basic`, the system will automatically use `registration_flow_config_basic` for registration.

> Note: Refer [Registration Flow Customization Guide](/docs/content/customize-registration-flow.md) for more details on configuring registration flows.

<summary><h3>üóÑÔ∏è Running with PostgreSQL Database</h3></summary>

#### üîß Step 1: Start PostgreSQL

- Create a Docker container for PostgreSQL with `thunderdb` database.

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=asgthunder \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=asgthunder \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=thunderdb \
    postgres
  ```

- Create the `runtimedb` in the same PostgreSQL container.

  ```bash
  docker exec -it postgres psql -U asgthunder -d thunderdb -c "CREATE DATABASE runtimedb;"
  ```

#### üóÇ Step 2: Initialize the Database

- Populate the `thunderdb` database with the required tables and data.

  ```bash
  docker exec -i postgres psql -U asgthunder -d thunderdb < backend/dbscripts/thunderdb/postgres.sql
  ```

- Populate the `runtimedb` database with the required tables and data.

  ```bash
  docker exec -i postgres psql -U asgthunder -d thunderdb < backend/dbscripts/runtimedb/postgres.sql
  ```

#### üõ† Step 3: Configure Thunder to Use PostgreSQL

1. Open the `backend/cmd/server/repository/conf/deployment.yaml` file.
2. Update the `database` section to point to the PostgreSQL database:
```yaml
database:
  identity:
    type: "postgres"
    hostname: "localhost"
    port: 5432
    name: "thunderdb"
    username: "asgthunder"
    password: "asgthunder"
    sslmode: "disable"
  runtime:
    type: "postgres"
    hostname: "localhost"
    port: 5432
    name: "runtimedb"
    username: "asgthunder"
    password: "asgthunder"
    sslmode: "disable"
```

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 4: Run the Product

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

The product will now use the PostgreSQL database for its operations.
