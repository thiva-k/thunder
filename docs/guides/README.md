# Thunder Documentation

Welcome to the Thunder documentation! This guide will help you understand and integrate Thunder's identity management capabilities into your applications.

## 📖 What is Thunder?

Thunder is a modern, open-source identity management service designed for teams building secure, customizable authentication experiences. It enables developers to design and orchestrate login, registration, and recovery flows using a flexible identity flow designer.

## Accessing the System APIs of Thunder

System APIs of Thunder are secured by default. You need to obtain an access token with `system` scope by authenticating as an admin user. Follow these steps:

1. **Initiate the authentication flow:**

   Run the following command, replacing `<application_id>` with the sample app ID generated during "Setup the product."

   ```bash
   curl -k -X POST 'https://localhost:8090/flow/execute' \
     -d '{"applicationId":"<application_id>","flowType":"AUTHENTICATION"}'
   ```

2. **Extract the flowId from the response:**

   ```json
   {"flowId":"<flow_id>","flowStatus":"INCOMPLETE", ...}
   ```

3. **Submit credentials:**

   Run the following command, replacing `<flow_id>` with the `flowId` value you extracted above.

   ```bash
   curl -k -X POST 'https://localhost:8090/flow/execute' \
     -d '{"flowId":"<flow_id>", "inputs":{"username":"admin","password":"admin","requested_permissions":"system"},"action":"action_001"}'
   ```

4. **Extract the assertion from the response:**

   Obtain the system API token by extracting the `assertion` value from the response.

   ```json
   {"flowId":"<flow_id>","flowStatus":"COMPLETE","data":{},"assertion":"<assertion>"}
   ```

3. **Use the assertion as a Bearer token:**

   Use this assertion value as the Bearer token in the `Authorization` header when calling Thunder management APIs:
   
   ```bash
   curl -kL -H 'Authorization: Bearer <assertion>' https://localhost:8090/applications
   ```

   > **Note:** In the API examples throughout this documentation, replace `<token>` with the assertion value you obtained from step 2.

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you're new to Thunder, we recommend starting with these resources:

1. **[Main README](/README.md)** - Quickstart guide to download and run Thunder
2. **[API Documentation](/api/)** - Explore the RESTful APIs

## 📚 API Documentation

Thunder provides comprehensive RESTful APIs for managing identity and access:

- [User Management API](/api/user.yaml)
- [Application Management API](/api/application.yaml)
- [Authentication APIs](/api/authentication.yaml)
- [Flow Management API](/api/flow-management.yaml)
- [Flow Execution API](/api/flow-execution.yaml)
- [Identity Provider Management API](/api/idp.yaml)
- [Notification Sender Management API](/api/notification-sender.yaml)
- [Group Management API](/api/group.yaml)
- [Organization Unit Management API](/api/ou.yaml)

## 🔧 Configuration

Thunder's configuration is managed through the `deployment.yaml` file located at `backend/cmd/server/repository/conf/deployment.yaml`. The configuration system supports three ways to provide values:

### Configuration Value Types

1. **Direct Values** - Static values specified directly in YAML:
   ```yaml
   server:
     hostname: "localhost"
     port: 8090
   ```

2. **Environment Variables** - Use Go template syntax `{{.VARIABLE_NAME}}` to reference environment variables:
   ```yaml
   database:
     identity:
       password: "{{.DB_PASSWORD}}"
   ```

3. **File References** - Use `file://` protocol to load content from files:
   ```yaml
   crypto:
     encryption:
       key: "file://repository/resources/security/crypto.key"
   ```
   Supports both quoted and unquoted paths:
   - `file://path/to/file` - Unquoted path (no spaces)
   - `file://"path/with spaces"` - Quoted path (with spaces allowed)
   - `file:///absolute/path` - Absolute paths
   - `file://relative/path` - Relative paths (resolved from the Thunder home directory)
