# Thunder API-Based Authentication Sample Application

This sample application demonstrates how to integrate Thunder authentication into a React application using direct API calls instead of SDK-based OAuth redirects. It showcases API-based user registration (sign-up) and authentication (sign-in) flows.

## Features

- User registration via Thunder's User Management API
- User authentication via Thunder's Credentials Authentication API
- JWT assertion token handling and display
- Dashboard with user list view
- User profile modal with decoded token information


## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A running Thunder server instance (default: `https://localhost:8090`)
- Thunder server configured with appropriate CORS settings
- SSL certificates (`server.key` and `server.cert`) in the project root
- The "Customer" user schema and "customers" organization unit created (via `02-sample-resources.sh` bootstrap script)

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure the Application

Edit `public/config.json` with your Thunder server settings:

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "https://localhost:8090"
}
```

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `baseUrl` | The base URL of your Thunder server |

### 2. Set Up SSL Certificates

The application runs on HTTPS. Copy the SSL certificates from your Thunder distribution:

```bash
# From Thunder distribution
cp /path/to/thunder/repository/resources/security/server.key .
cp /path/to/thunder/repository/resources/security/server.cert .

# Or from build output (if building from source)
cp ../../target/out/.cert/server.key .
cp ../../target/out/.cert/server.cert .
```

### 3. Set Up Sample Resources

Run the bootstrap script to create the required "Customer" user schema and "customers" organization unit:

```bash
# From the project root
./backend/cmd/server/bootstrap/02-sample-resources.sh
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)

### Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server with hot reloading |
| `npm run build` | Build for production (outputs to `dist/`) |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint to check code quality |

## Important: Sign-Up Requirements

To use the sign-up functionality, you need to temporarily disable Thunder security by setting the following environment variable before starting the Thunder server:

```bash
export THUNDER_SKIP_SECURITY=true
```

This is required because the sign-up API creates users without authentication. In a production environment, you would typically use a different approach such as:
- OAuth-based registration flows
- Admin-created user accounts
- Custom registration endpoints with appropriate security controls

## API Endpoints Used

This sample interacts with the following Thunder APIs:

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/credentials/authenticate` - Authenticate user with username/password

### User Management
- `GET /users` - List registered users
- `POST /users` - Register a new user

### Organization Units
- `GET /organization-units` - Get available organization units

## How It Works

### Sign-Up Flow
1. User fills in the registration form (username, name, email, password)
2. Application fetches the "customers" organization unit ID
3. Sends a POST request to `/users` with user attributes and type "Customer"
4. On success, displays confirmation message

### Sign-In Flow
1. User enters username and password
2. Application sends credentials to `/auth/credentials/authenticate`
3. On success, receives an assertion token (JWT)
4. Token is stored in sessionStorage
5. User is redirected to the dashboard

### Dashboard
- Displays the authenticated user's information
- Shows a table of all registered users
- Allows viewing detailed profile information in a modal

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Failed to fetch" errors
- Ensure Thunder server is running and accessible at the configured base URL
- Check CORS configuration in Thunder's `deployment.yaml`

**Issue**: "User schema not found" error during sign-up
- Run the `02-sample-resources.sh` bootstrap script to create the "Customer" user schema

**Issue**: "Organization unit not found" error during sign-up
- Run the `02-sample-resources.sh` bootstrap script to create the "customers" organization unit

**Issue**: Sign-up fails with authentication/authorization errors
- Ensure `THUNDER_SKIP_SECURITY=true` is set when starting the Thunder server

**Issue**: CORS errors
- Add your application URL to "Allowed Origins" in Thunder's configuration:
  ```yaml
  cors:
    allowed_origins:
      - "https://localhost:3000"
  ```

**Issue**: SSL certificate errors
- Ensure `server.key` and `server.cert` exist in the project root
- Run `./build.sh run_backend` from the project root to auto-generate certificates

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.
