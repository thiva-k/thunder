// Scenario: the Concierge delegates a sub-task to a worker agent.
//
// This is the multi-agent scenario from the docs: a travel-planning agent holds a token scoped to
// search, read, and book, and hands the search sub-task to a flight-search worker that gets only
// the search scope. Two things happen at every hop, and both are visible below: the token narrows,
// and the `act` (actor) claim records who carried the work.
