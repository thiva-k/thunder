// Scenario: the Concierge acts on behalf of John Doe.
//
// The OAuth client is an agent, so every access token issued from a user login names the user as
// `sub` and the agent as `act` (actor). That makes it an on-behalf-of token by construction, with no
// extra exchange required. The refresh and token-exchange actions then show the actor being carried
// and the authority being narrowed.
//
// This is the only scenario that needs a browser round trip, so it owns the extra routes below.
// `/callback` stays at the root because it must match the agent's registered redirect URI exactly.
