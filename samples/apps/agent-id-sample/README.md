# Agent Identity Sample (Wayfinder)

End-to-end sample of an AI agent that holds its own ThunderID-managed identity.

The agent uses **its own access token (client_credentials grant)** for browsing tools. When a tool needs the user's consent (booking, cancellation, reading the user's own data), it switches to a **user-context token**. That token is obtained via **OAuth 2.0 authorization-code + PKCE**.

The sample is a travel booking app called Wayfinder. A chat widget in the UI talks to a LangChain agent that calls REST tools through an MCP server.

    Chat -- "POST /chat<br/>+ user token<br/>(agent:access)" --> Agent
    Agent -- "M2M token<br/>(client_credentials)" --> MCP
    Agent -. "OBO token<br/>(authorization_code + PKCE)" .-> MCP
    MCP --> API

    Thunder -- "user sign-in<br/>(authorization_code)" --> UI
    Thunder -- "M2M token" --> Agent
    Thunder -. "OBO consent popup" .-> Chat
```

### Token Flow

The sample uses two OAuth clients and three token types:

| Token | OAuth Client | Grant | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|-------|---------|
| **User token** | `WAYFINDER` | `authorization_code` | Frontend sign-in, API calls, chat API auth (`agent:access` scope) |
| **M2M token** | `WAYFINDER-CHAT-AGENT` | `client_credentials` | Agent's own identity for browsing tools (search flights, hotels) via MCP |
| **OBO token** | `WAYFINDER-CHAT-AGENT` | `authorization_code` + PKCE | User-context token for mutating tools (booking, cancellation) via MCP |

**How it works:**

1. The user signs in to the Wayfinder web app via the `WAYFINDER` OAuth application. The issued token carries `agent:access` (from the Wayfinder Chat User role).
2. When the user sends a chat message, the frontend calls `POST /chat` on the AI Agent API with the user's access token in the `Authorization` header. The AI Agent validates the token has the `agent:access` scope before processing the message.
3. For browsing tools (search flights, search hotels), the AI Agent uses its own M2M token (obtained via `client_credentials` with the `WAYFINDER-CHAT-AGENT` credentials) to call the MCP server, which proxies to the REST API.
4. For mutating tools (create booking, cancel booking), the AI Agent returns a `need_user_consent` response. The frontend opens a consent popup, the user signs in and picks which booking permissions to grant (`booking:read`, `booking:create`, `booking:cancel`), and the authorization code is submitted to `POST /chat/consent`. The agent exchanges it for a user-context token, and the frontend retries the original message.
5. The REST API validates the JWT on every request and enforces scopes per route — browsing endpoints are open, booking endpoints require the matching `booking:*` scope.

## What This Demonstrates

- A ThunderID **agent** acting as an autonomous principal — distinct from a ThunderID user.
- The agent's **machine-to-machine (M2M) token** used for read-only browsing tools (search flights, search hotels, recommend flights, etc.).
- **Scope-based access control** on the AI Agent's HTTP API — only users with `agent:access` can use the chat. Users without this scope (e.g. `jane.smith`) can browse and book through the UI but cannot use the chat agent.
- An **on-behalf-of (OBO)** flow triggered from inside a chat session: the agent returns a consent request, the frontend opens a popup where the user picks which booking permissions to grant, and the issued user-context token only carries the approved subset.
- A REST API that **verifies the JWT** and **enforces scopes per route** (`booking:read`, `booking:create`, `booking:cancel`, `flight:recommend`).
- A **self-service profile page** at `/profile` that calls Thunder's `/users/me` directly with the `WAYFINDER` user token to read account details, edit attributes, and change the password.
- **Multi-LLM support** — the chat agent works with both **Anthropic Claude** and **Google Gemini**, selectable via an environment variable.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A running ThunderID backend on `https://localhost:8090` (self-signed cert is fine).
- **One** of the following LLM API keys:
  - Anthropic API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com), **or**
  - Google Gemini API key from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com).

### Allow the frontend origin in Thunder

The Wayfinder web app runs on `http://localhost:5173` and calls Thunder directly for `/oauth2/authorize`, `/oauth2/token`, and `/users/me`. Browsers block these cross-origin calls unless Thunder's CORS allow-list includes the frontend origin.

Edit `backend/cmd/server/repository/conf/deployment.yaml` and add `http://localhost:5173` under `cors.allowed_origins`. Leave any existing entries in place — they belong to other samples.

```yaml
cors:
  allowed_origins:
    # ...existing entries...
    - "http://localhost:5173"
```

Restart the ThunderID server after the change. If you serve the frontend from a different host or port, add that origin instead.

## ThunderID Setup

The `resources/` directory contains declarative YAML files that configure most of the ThunderID entities automatically. The agent must still be created manually since declarative agent support is not yet available.

### Step 1 — Load Declarative Resources

Find your ThunderID default organization unit ID. You can find it in the Console UI under **Organization Units**, or query the database:

```bash
sqlite3 backend/cmd/server/repository/database/configdb.db \
  "SELECT OU_ID FROM RESOURCE_SERVER WHERE NAME='System' LIMIT 1;"
```

Copy the sample's `resources/` subdirectories into ThunderID's declarative resource directory and set the OU ID:

```bash
export THUNDER_OU_ID=<your-ou-id>

# Copy resource files into the ThunderID server's resources directory
cp -r samples/apps/agent-id-sample/resources/resource_servers \
      backend/cmd/server/repository/resources/
cp -r samples/apps/agent-id-sample/resources/roles \
      backend/cmd/server/repository/resources/
cp -r samples/apps/agent-id-sample/resources/users \
      backend/cmd/server/repository/resources/
cp -r samples/apps/agent-id-sample/resources/applications \
      backend/cmd/server/repository/resources/
```

Restart the ThunderID server. On startup it will load:

| Resource | File | What it creates |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| Resource server | `resource_servers/wayfinder-agent.yaml` | `wayfinder-agent` resource server with `agent:access` permission |
| Resource server | `resource_servers/booking-api.yaml` | `booking-api` resource server with `booking:read`, `booking:create`, `booking:cancel` permissions |
| Role | `roles/wayfinder-chat-user.yaml` | **Wayfinder Chat User** role with `agent:access`, assigned to `john.doe` |
| Role | `roles/wayfinder-user.yaml` | **Wayfinder User** role with booking permissions, assigned to both demo users |
| User | `users/john-doe.yaml` | Demo user `john.doe` / `john.doe` — has chat agent access and booking permissions |
| User | `users/jane-smith.yaml` | Demo user `jane.smith` / `jane.smith` — has booking permissions but **no** chat agent access |
| Application | `applications/wayfinder.yaml` | `WAYFINDER` OAuth app (public, PKCE, redirect to `http://localhost:5173`) |

### Step 2 — Manual Steps

These steps cannot be done declaratively yet:

**Create the agent.** In the Console UI or via the management API, create an agent named **`WAYFINDER-CHAT-AGENT`**:

1. Create the agent and capture the **client secret** — ThunderID prints it only once at creation. You will need it for `ai-agent/.env`.
2. Under the agent's **Protocol** settings, enable the **Authorization Code** grant (the Client Credentials grant is enabled by default for agents).
3. Add the authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:5173/agent-callback`
4. Set the authentication flow to the built-in **Default Basic Authentication Flow** (`default-basic-flow`).
5. Under `accessToken.userAttributes`, add: `given_name`, `family_name`, `email`, `groups`.

## Configure the Sample

`api/`, `ai-agent/`, and `frontend/` each ship with a `.env.example` listing only the variables you actually need to set. In each of those folders, copy it to `.env` and fill the placeholders. The `mcp/` server has no required configuration.

The two placeholder values you must replace are in `ai-agent/.env`:

- `AGENT_SECRET=` — the agent client secret captured at agent creation.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY=`) — your LLM API key.

Everything else in the examples is local development defaults that match the run instructions below.

## Run

In four terminals:

```bash
cd api      && npm install && npm run seed && npm start   # http://localhost:8787
cd mcp      && npm install && npm start                   # http://localhost:8000/mcp
cd ai-agent && npm install && npm start                   # http://localhost:8790/chat
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev                 # http://localhost:5173
```

`npm run seed` initializes the local SQLite database with sample flights, hotels, and trips. Run it once on first setup.

## Try It

Open `http://localhost:5173`, sign in as `john.doe` / `john.doe`, open the chat widget, and try:

```
What flights are there from Colombo to Singapore?
```

These browsing tools use the agent's M2M token — no popup beyond the initial sign-in.

You can also ask the agent for general recommendations — for example:

```
Suggest a few flight deals.
```

This calls the `recommend_flights` MCP tool, which hits `GET /api/flights/recommended` with the agent's M2M token. The endpoint requires the `flight:recommend` scope, which is granted to the `WAYFINDER-CHAT-AGENT` agent via its role assignment.

Then:

```
Book flight 2
```

The agent will pause and ask for your permission. A popup opens and you sign in as the demo user via the agent's OAuth application. You pick which booking permissions to grant in the consent screen. The booking then succeeds — or returns 403 if you denied `booking:create`.

### Manage Your Profile

Click your name in the top-right corner and pick **Profile** to view your account details, edit profile attributes, or change your password. The page calls Thunder's `/users/me`, `PUT /users/me`, and `POST /users/me/update-credentials` directly with the `WAYFINDER` user token — no scope beyond a valid user JWT is required.

### No Chat Access

Sign out and sign in as `jane.smith` / `jane.smith`. Jane can browse flights, hotels, and manage bookings through the web UI. Sending a chat message returns a 403 error — her token lacks the `agent:access` scope because she is not assigned the **Wayfinder Chat User** role.
